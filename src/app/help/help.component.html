        This program is supposed to help you learn typing fast with the ten finger typing system also known as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch typing</a>.
      </div>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        Place your fingers on the home row (the middle row on your keyboard) and start typing the characters
        in the text field. Most keyboards have a little marker where your index fingers should be
        (on an English keyboard the F and J key).
      </div>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        As you are typing the correct keys they get marked in green.<br>
        If you make an error you have to restart the lesson. The idea being that your typing speed will suffer a lot if
        you make any errors and this modes will help you learn not to make any errors. We know this can be a little
        frustrating at first, but we hope it will be for your long-term happiness.
        You don't have to type the spaces or newlines, but you can if you want to.

      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        You get one score point for every character typed correctly.<br>
        And a lot of points for completing a lesson successfully.<br>
        If you type than more than 20 characters correctly you get some points as well.<br>
        <br>
        You do not have to finish a lesson to go the the next lesson, just use the navigation buttons below the text
        area.
        You can complete a lesson as many times as you want or not at all. It's all up to you and what you what achive.
        Lesson five and six use some real words you can type on the home row instead of randomly generated ones.
        Lesson 23 to 25 use some text from the Dīgha Nikāya Buddhist Sutta Number 34 - Sangīti Sutta.

        If you click the user icon (
        <mat-icon>account_circle</mat-icon>
        ) on the top row you can choose a user name.
        Keep in mind you have to set the user name every time you reload the page (for now...).<br>
        There is a high score reachable via the top row high score icon (
        <mat-icon>bar_chart</mat-icon>
        ) as well.<br>
        The lesson icon in the top row (
        <mat-icon>fitness_center</mat-icon>
        ) starts a new training session.

        You can change the keyboard layout used to generate the Lessons from QWERTY to a custom Pali layout in the
        select box below the text in the lesson view.
