dn34English[0] = 'Up to Ten\n\n' +

  'So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a ' +
  'large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: "Reverends, mendicants!" "Reverend," ' +
  `they replied. Sāriputta said this:

"I will relate the teachings
up to ten for attaining extinguishment,
for making an end of suffering,
the release from all ties.`;

dn34English[1] = '1. Groups of One\n\n' +
  'Reverends, one thing is helpful, one thing should be developed, one thing should be completely understood, one thing ' +
  'should be given up, one thing makes things worse, one thing leads to distinction, one thing is hard to comprehend, one ' +
  `thing should be produced, one thing should be directly known, one thing should be realized.

What one thing is helpful? Diligence in skillful qualities.
What one thing should be developed? Mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.
What one thing should be completely understood? Contact, which is accompanied by defilements and is prone to being grasped.
What one thing should be given up? The conceit ‘I am’.
What one thing makes things worse? Improper attention.
What one thing leads to distinction? Proper attention.
What one thing is hard to comprehend? The heart’s immersion of immediate result.
What one thing should be produced? Unshakable knowledge.
What one thing should be directly known? All sentient beings are sustained by food.
What one thing should be realized? The unshakable heart’s release.

So these ten things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly awakened to by the Realized One.`;

dn34English[2] = '2. Groups of Two\n\n' +
  'Two things are helpful, two things should be developed, two things should be completely understood, two things should be ' +
  'given up, two things make things worse, two things lead to distinction, two things are hard to comprehend, two things should ' +
  `be produced, two things should be directly known, two things should be realized.

What two things are helpful? Mindfulness and situational awareness.
What two things should be developed? Serenity and discernment.
What two things should be completely understood? Name and form.
What two things should be given up? Ignorance and craving for continued existence.
What two things make things worse? Being hard to admonish and having bad friends.
What two things lead to distinction? Being easy to admonish and having good friends.
What two things are hard to comprehend? What are the causes and conditions for the corruption of sentient beings, and what
are the causes and conditions for the purification of sentient beings.
What two things should be produced? Two knowledges: knowledge of ending, and knowledge of non-arising.
What two things should be directly known? Two elements: the conditioned element and the unconditioned element.
What two things should be realized? Knowledge and freedom.

So these twenty things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly awakened to by the Realized One.`;

patimokkhaEnglish[0] = 'Pārājika: Rules entailing expulsion from the Sangha (Defeat)\n\n' +
  `1. Should any bhikkhu — participating in the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus,
without having renounced the training, without having declared his weakness — engage in
sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is defeatedand no longer in affiliation.

2. Should any bhikkhu, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an
inhabited area or from the wilderness — just as when, in the taking of what is not given,
kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish him, saying, "You are a robber,
you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief" — a bhikkhu in the same way taking what
is not given also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.`;

patimokkhaEnglish[1] =
  `3. Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an
assassin for him, or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,):
"My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? Death would be better for
you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways
praise the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in
affiliation.

4. Should any bhikkhu, without direct knowledge, claim a superior human state, a truly
noble knowledge and vision, as present in himself, saying, "Thus do I know; thus do I see,"
such that regardless of whether or not he is cross-examined on a later occasion, he — being
remorseful and desirous of purification — might say, "Friends, not knowing, I said I know;
not seeing, I said I see — vainly, falsely, idly," unless it was from over-estimation,
he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.`;
