dn34English[0] = 'Up to Ten\n\n' +

  'So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond together with a ' +
  'large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: "Reverends, mendicants!" "Reverend," ' +
  `they replied. Sāriputta said this:

"I will relate the teachings
up to ten for attaining extinguishment,
for making an end of suffering,
the release from all ties.`;

dn34English[1] = '1. Groups of One\n\n' +
  'Reverends, one thing is helpful, one thing should be developed, one thing should be completely understood, one thing ' +
  'should be given up, one thing makes things worse, one thing leads to distinction, one thing is hard to comprehend, one ' +
  `thing should be produced, one thing should be directly known, one thing should be realized.

What one thing is helpful? Diligence in skillful qualities.
What one thing should be developed? Mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.
What one thing should be completely understood? Contact, which is accompanied by defilements and is prone to being grasped.
What one thing should be given up? The conceit ‘I am’.
What one thing makes things worse? Improper attention.
What one thing leads to distinction? Proper attention.
What one thing is hard to comprehend? The heart’s immersion of immediate result.
What one thing should be produced? Unshakable knowledge.
What one thing should be directly known? All sentient beings are sustained by food.
What one thing should be realized? The unshakable heart’s release.

So these ten things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly awakened to by the Realized One.`;

dn34English[2] = '2. Groups of Two\n\n' +
  'Two things are helpful, two things should be developed, two things should be completely understood, two things should be ' +
  'given up, two things make things worse, two things lead to distinction, two things are hard to comprehend, two things should ' +
  `be produced, two things should be directly known, two things should be realized.

What two things are helpful? Mindfulness and situational awareness.
What two things should be developed? Serenity and discernment.
What two things should be completely understood? Name and form.
What two things should be given up? Ignorance and craving for continued existence.
What two things make things worse? Being hard to admonish and having bad friends.
What two things lead to distinction? Being easy to admonish and having good friends.
What two things are hard to comprehend? What are the causes and conditions for the corruption of sentient beings, and what
are the causes and conditions for the purification of sentient beings.
What two things should be produced? Two knowledges: knowledge of ending, and knowledge of non-arising.
What two things should be directly known? Two elements: the conditioned element and the unconditioned element.
What two things should be realized? Knowledge and freedom.

So these twenty things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly awakened to by the Realized One.`;

patimokkhaEnglish[0] = 'Pārājika: Rules entailing expulsion from the Sangha (Defeat)\n\n' +
  '1. Should any bhikkhu — participating in the training and livelihood of the bhikkhus, without having renounced the training, ' +
  'without having declared his weakness — engage in sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is defeatedand no longer ' +
  'in affiliation.\n\n' +
  '2. Should any bhikkhu, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness — ' +
  'just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish him, saying, ' +
  '"You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief" — a bhikkhu in the same way taking what is not given ' +
  'also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.';

patimokkhaEnglish[1] = '3. Should any bhikkhu intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for him, ' +
  'or praise the advantages of death, or incite him to die (saying,): "My good man, what use is this evil, miserable life to you? ' +
  'Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise ' +
  'the advantages of death or incite him to die, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.\n\n' +
  '4. Should any bhikkhu, without direct knowledge, claim a superior human state, a truly noble knowledge and vision, as present ' +
  'in himself, saying, "Thus do I know; thus do I see," such that regardless of whether or not he is cross-examined on a later ' +
  'occasion, he — being remorseful and desirous of purification — might say, "Friends, not knowing, I said I know; not seeing, I said ' +
  'I see — vainly, falsely, idly," unless it was from over-estimation, he also is defeated and no longer in affiliation.';

patimokkhaEnglish[2] = 'Saṅghādisesa: Rules entailing an initial and subsequent meeting of the Sangha\n\n' +
  '1. Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.\n\n' +
  '2. Should any bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, engage in bodily contact with a woman, or in holding her hand, ' +
  'holding a lock of her hair, or caressing any of her limbs, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.\n\n' +
  '3. Should any bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, address lewd words to a woman in the manner of young men to a young ' +
  'woman alluding to sexual intercourse, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.\n\n' +
  '4. Should any bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, speak in the presence of a woman in praise of ministering to his ' +
  'own sensuality thus: "This, sister, is the foremost ministration, that of ministering to a virtuous, fine-natured follower of the ' +
  'celibate life such as myself with this act" — alluding to sexual intercourse — it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the ' +
  'Community.';

patimokkhaEnglish[3] = '5. Should any bhikkhu engage in conveying a man\'s intentions to a woman or a woman\'s intentions to a man, ' +
  'proposing marriage or paramourage — even if only for a momentary liaison — it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the ' +
  'Community.\n\n' +
  '6. When a bhikkhu is having a hut built from (gains acquired by) his own begging — having no sponsor and destined for himself — ' +
  'he is to have it built to the standard measurement. Here the standard is this: twelve spans, using the sugata span, in length ' +
  '(measuring outside); seven in width, (measuring) inside. Bhikkhus are to be assembled to designate the site. The site the bhikkhus ' +
  'designate should be without disturbances and with adequate space. If the bhikkhu should have a hut built from his own begging on a ' +
  'site with disturbances and without adequate space, or if he should not assemble the bhikkhus to designate the site, or if he should ' +
  'have the standard exceeded, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.\n\n' +
  '7. When a bhikkhu is having a large dwelling built — having a sponsor and destined for himself — he is to assemble bhikkhus to ' +
  'designate the site. The site the bhikkhus designate should be without disturbances and with adequate space. If the bhikkhu should ' +
  'have a large dwelling built on a site with disturbances and without adequate space, or if he should not assemble the bhikkhus to ' +
  'designate the site, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.';

patimokkhaEnglish[4] = '8. Should any bhikkhu — corrupt, aversive, disgruntled — charge a bhikkhu with an unfounded case entailing ' +
  'defeat, (thinking), "Perhaps I may bring about his fall from this celibate life," then regardless of whether or not he is ' +
  'cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue is unfounded and the bhikkhu confesses his aversion, it entails initial and ' +
  'subsequent meetings of the Community.\n\n' +
  '9. Should any bhikkhu — corrupt, aversive, disgruntled — using as a mere ploy an aspect of an issue that pertains otherwise, ' +
  'charge a bhikkhu with a case entailing defeat, (thinking), "Perhaps I may bring about his fall from this celibate life," then ' +
  'regardless of whether or not he is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue pertains otherwise, an aspect used as a mere ' +
  'ploy, and the bhikkhu confesses his aversion, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.\n\n';

patimokkhaEnglish[5] = '10. Should any bhikkhu agitate for a schism in a united Community, or should he persist in taking up an issue ' +
  'conducive to schism, the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "Do not, venerable sir, agitate for a schism in a united Community or ' +
  'persist in taking up an issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable one be reconciled with the Community, for a united Community, ' +
  'on courteous terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, dwells in peace."\n' +
  'And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times for ' +
  'the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times he relinquishes that, that is good. If he does not ' +
  'relinquish (that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.';

patimokkhaEnglish[6] = '11. Should bhikkhus — one, two, or three — who are followers and partisans of that bhikkhu, say, "Do not, ' +
  'venerable sirs, admonish that bhikkhu in any way. He is an exponent of the Dhamma. He is an exponent of the Vinaya. He acts with our ' +
  'consent and approval. He knows, he speaks for us, and that is pleasing to us," the bhikkhus are to admonish them thus: "Do not say ' +
  'that, venerable sirs. That bhikkhu is not an exponent of the Dhamma and he is not an exponent of the Vinaya. Do not, venerable sirs, ' +
  'approve of a schism in the Community. Let the venerable ones\' (minds) be reconciled with the Community, for a united Community, on ' +
  'courteous terms, without dispute, with a common recitation, dwells in peace."\n' +
  'And should those bhikkhus, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke them up to three times for ' +
  'the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times they relinquish that, that is good. If they do not ' +
  'relinquish (that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.';

patimokkhaEnglish[7] = '12. In case a bhikkhu is by nature difficult to admonish — who, when being legitimately admonished by the ' +
  'bhikkhus with reference to the training rules included in the (Pāṭimokkha) recitation, makes himself unadmonishable, (saying,) ' +
  '"Do not, venerable ones, say anything to me, good or bad; and I won\'t say anything to the venerable ones, good or bad. Refrain, ' +
  'venerable ones, from admonishing me" — the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "Let the venerable one not make himself unadmonishable. ' +
  'Let the venerable one make himself admonishable. Let the venerable one admonish the bhikkhus in accordance with what is right, and ' +
  'the bhikkhus will admonish the venerable one in accordance with what is right; for it is thus that the Blessed One\'s following ' +
  'is nurtured: through mutual admonition, through mutual rehabilitation."\n' +
  'And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times for ' +
  'the sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times he relinquishes that, that is good. If he does not ' +
  'relinquish (that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.';

patimokkhaEnglish[8] = '13. In case a bhikkhu living in dependence on a certain village or town is a corrupter of families, a man ' +
  'of depraved conduct — whose depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families he has corrupted are both seen and ' +
  'heard about — the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "You, venerable sir, are a corrupter of families, a man of depraved conduct. ' +
  'Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this ' +
  'monastery, venerable sir. Enough of your staying here."\n' +
  'And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, say about the bhikkhus, "The bhikkhus are biased through favoritism, biased ' +
  'through aversion, biased through delusion, biased through fear, in that for this sort of offense they banish some and do not banish ' +
  'others," the bhikkhus are to admonish him thus: "Do not say that, venerable sir. The bhikkhus are not biased through favoritism, are ' +
  'not biased through aversion, are not biased through delusion, are not biased through fear. You, venerable sir, are a corrupter of ' +
  'families, a man of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both ' +
  'seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, venerable sir. Enough of your staying here."\n' +
  'And should that bhikkhu, thus admonished by the bhikkhus, persist as before, the bhikkhus are to rebuke him up to three times for the ' +
  'sake of relinquishing that. If while being rebuked up to three times he relinquishes that, that is good. If he does not relinquish ' +
  '(that), it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.';
