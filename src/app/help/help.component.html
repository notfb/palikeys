      <h2 class="pk-text-center">Touch Typing</h2>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        This program is supposed to help you learn typing faster with the ten finger typing system also known as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch typing</a>.
      </div>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        Please place your fingers on the home row (the middle row on your keyboard) and start typing the characters
        in the text field. Most keyboards have a little physical marker where your index fingers should be placed
        (on an English or German keyboard the F and J key).
      </div>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        As you are typing the correct keys they get marked in green.<br>
        If you make an error you have to restart the lesson. The idea being that your typing speed will suffer a lot if
        you make any errors and this modes will help you learn not to make any errors. We know this can be a little
        frustrating at first, but we kindly request your patience and hope it will benefit your long-term happiness.
        You do not have to type the spaces or newlines, but you can if you want to.
      </div>
      <h2 class="pk-text-center">Keyboard Layouts</h2>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        You can change the keyboard layout used to generate the Lessons from QWERTY to a custom Pali layout in the
        select box below the text in the lesson view (
        <mat-icon>keyboard</mat-icon>
        ). The current layout is shown on the button of the screen. The keys needed for this lesson are highlighted.<br>
        If you want to try the Pali layout without installing a custom layout on your computer, then you can choose a
        mapping from the select box with the text 'No Mapping'. Change it to 'QWERTY -> Pali Meat' to map an English
        Keyboard.<br>
        An Auto Hot Key config file etc. of the
        <a href="https://github.com/notfb/palikeys/tree/master/layout">Pali layout</a> can be found on github.
      </div>
      <h2 class="pk-text-center">High Scores</h2>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        You get one score point for every character typed correctly and a lot of points for completing a lesson
        successfully.<br>
        If you type than more than 20 characters correctly you get some points as well.<br>
        <br>
        You do not have to finish a lesson to go the the next lesson. You can use the navigation buttons below the text
        area to skip lessons.
        You can complete a lesson as many times as you want or not at all. It's all up to you and what you what to
        learn.
        <a routerLink="/lesson/qwerty/5">Lesson five</a> and <a routerLink="/lesson/qwerty/6">six</a>
        use real words you can type on the home row instead of randomly generated ones.<br>
        <a routerLink="/lesson/qwerty/23">Lesson 23</a> to <a routerLink="/lesson/qwerty/25">25</a>
        use some text from the Dīgha Nikāya Buddhist Sutta Number 34 -
        <a href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34/en/sujato">Sangīti Sutta</a>.
      </div>
      <h2 class="pk-text-center">Navigation</h2>
      <div class="pk-padding-bottom-s">
        If you click the user icon (
        <mat-icon>account_circle</mat-icon>
        ) on the top row you can choose a user name.
        Keep in mind you have to set the user name every time you reload the page (for now...).<br>
        There is a high score reachable via the top row high score icon (

        ) as well.<br>
